# Advancing Assamese A.I.: A Journey by Navdyut AI Research & Tech Labs

## Introduction

At Navdyut AI Research & Tech Labs, we strive to empower communities by seamlessly merging cultural authenticity with advanced technology. Assamese, rich in cultural heritage and linguistic intricacy, offers unique challenges and opportunities. Our commitment is to harness Artificial Intelligence to bridge linguistic gaps, nurturing the Assamese language with solutions that are practical, accurate, and resource-efficient.

## The Importance of Assamese A.I.

The Assamese language, with its unique script and complex grammatical rules, has been historically underserved by mainstream language technologies. Although modern language technologies promise impressive capabilities, they're often resource-intensive and fail to capture regional cultural nuances effectively. Our approach is centered on building robust Assamese language technology that's culturally resonant, accessible, and optimized specifically for local constraints.

## A Closer Look: How Advanced Language Models Work

### Transformer Framework

Transformers utilize a mechanism known as self-attention, fundamentally described as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Here, queries ($Q$), keys ($K$), and values ($V$) are computed from input data using learned transformations:

$$
Q = XW^Q,\quad K = XW^K,\quad V = XW^V
$$

### Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention refines context awareness by processing multiple attention operations in parallel:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

Each head individually processes:

$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

### Positional Encoding

To retain sequential information, positional encoding uses sinusoidal functions:

$$
PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right),\quad PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
$$

### Cross-Entropy Loss

The training loss typically used in language models is cross-entropy:

$$
\ell(p, q) = -\sum_{j} p_j \log(q_j)
$$

### Optimization Methods

Model parameters ($θ$) are iteratively updated using gradient descent:

$$
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - η ∇_θ \mathcal{L}(θ_t)
$$

Advanced optimization methods, like Adam, dynamically refine these updates:

$$
m_t = β_1 m_{t-1} + (1-β_1) ∇_θ \mathcal{L}(θ_t), \quad v_t = β_2 v_{t-1} + (1-β_2)(∇_θ \mathcal{L}(θ_t))^2
$$

$$
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - η \frac{\hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t}+ε}
$$

### Layer Normalization

To maintain stable and efficient training, transformers apply layer normalization:

$$
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = γ \frac{x - μ}{σ + ε} + β
$$

where parameters ($γ$, $β$) adjust normalization dynamically.

## Our Unique Approach at Navdyut

Recognizing computational limits, we adopt optimized, compact models combined with specialized techniques designed for the Assamese context.

### Tailored Assamese Tokenizer

Addressing Assamese linguistic complexity, our tokenizer segments text by selecting the most probable sequence:

$$
T^*(s) = \arg\max_{T}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log P(t_i)\right)
$$

Probabilities are carefully estimated to manage sparse linguistic data:

$$
P(t_i) = \frac{C(t_i) + α}{N + αV}
$$

Performance evaluation uses a perplexity metric:

$$
\text{Perplexity} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\log P(t_i)\right)
$$

### Efficiency Metrics

To objectively measure and improve efficiency, we calculate a performance-to-cost ratio:

$$
E = \frac{\text{Accuracy}}{\text{Compute Cost (FLOPs)}}
$$

Compute costs are approximated:

$$
\text{FLOPs} \approx O(n^2 \cdot d)
$$

### Understanding Training Dynamics

We carefully monitor training progress through exponential convergence analysis:

$$
\mathcal{L}(t) = \mathcal{L}_0 e^{-γt} + ε_t
$$

This captures both convergence trends and variability.

### Performance Validation (BLEU Scores)

Translation accuracy is validated using metrics such as BLEU:

$$
\text{BLEU} = BP \cdot \exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_n \log p_n\right)
$$

where higher scores indicate greater translation precision.
